- **Thoroughly Tested**: Backend covered with JUnit and Mockito tests for reliability.  

## üß† Music-Matching Algorithm
The core of this application is a sophisticated music-matching algorithm designed to achieve the highest possible accuracy when transferring playlists. The process involves two main stages: Query Construction and Scoring & Matching.

**1. Query Construction**
Instead of using a generic search query for all platforms, the algorithm constructs a unique, optimized query for each target service (e.g., Spotify, YouTube). This is crucial because each platform's search API behaves differently and prioritizes different metadata.

- **Trustworthy Platforms**: For platforms with reliable metadata like **Spotify** and **Deezer**, the query is built using a combination of the song title, artist, and album.

- **Other Platforms**: For platforms where metadata can be less structured, like **YouTube** and **SoundCloud**, the query is a normalized version of the track name.

This platform-specific approach ensures that the initial search results from the target platform's API are as relevant as possible, which is the foundation for accurate matching.

**2. Scoring & Matching**
Once the search results are retrieved, each potential match is scored against the original song based on a weighted system. This scoring system is designed to mimic human intuition by prioritizing the most reliable identifiers.

The scoring is based on the following factors, with bonuses for strong indicators and penalties for mismatches:

- **ISRC Match**: The highest bonus is awarded for an exact match of the **International Standard Recording Code (ISRC)**, as this is a unique identifier for a specific recording.

- **Title, Artist, and Album**: A combination of **fuzzy matching** and **Jaccard** similarity is used to score the similarity of the song title, artist, and album. Exact matches receive a significant bonus, while mismatches incur a penalty.

- **Duration**: A large bonus is given for an exact duration match, with a smaller bonus for durations within a close tolerance (e.g., +/- 5 seconds). Significant deviations in duration result in a penalty.

- **Keyword Matching**: The algorithm extracts keywords from the song's metadata (like "live", "remix", "acoustic") and awards a bonus for each overlapping keyword between the source and the potential match.

- **Music Indicators**: For platforms like YouTube, a bonus is given if the video description contains keywords like "music" or "song" as these are strong indicators of an official audio track.

The song with the highest total score is selected as the best match, ensuring a highly accurate and reliable playlist transfer.
